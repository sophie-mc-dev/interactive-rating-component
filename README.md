## Overview

### The challenge

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned

```css
background: radial-gradient(
  farthest-side at top center,
  hsl(215deg, 19%, 15%),
  hsl(215deg, 27%, 12%)
);
```

### Continued development

In the future I want to keep focusing on Flexbox and CSS layout styles since I had to change my approach quite a few times with this project as I wasn't getting the results I wanted in terms of spacing between elements.
